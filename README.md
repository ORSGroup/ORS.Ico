# ORS ICO

Consists of the following subprojects:

* preico - a list of pre-ICO investors and their holdings
* whitelist - a list of addresses allowed to buy from the ICO, presumably as
  they have registered by some outside mechanism
* token - ERC20/ERC223/EthereumToken compliant token
* ico - the smart contract that sells ORS to buyers on the whitelist
