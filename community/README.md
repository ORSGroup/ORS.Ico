# ORS Community

In order to promote the ICO and future ORS business. we establish a set of
communities. These may be organized by nation, such as one community for Russia,
one for Korea and another for Italy. Communities could also be organized in
other ways, such as a Facebook community, a LinkedIn community and so on.

Each community may have its own bonus scheme, so if someone in a community
buys tokens then s/he receives the community-specific bonus rate.

Each community has a manager, but the managers are not knowledgable on smart
contracts so we cannot delegate admin responsibility and there will be one
owner managing the smart contract. The smart contract remembers the manager
address in case the manager should be rewarded by the population and actions
of the community.
